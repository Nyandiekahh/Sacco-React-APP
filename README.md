## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nyandiekahh/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the app, you need to set up environment variables for Firebase.

1. **Create a `.env` file:**

   In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.env`.

2. **Add the following environment variables:**

   ```env
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
   ```

   Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration values.

3. **Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`:**

   Make sure your `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to the repository.

   ```plaintext
   .env
   ```
